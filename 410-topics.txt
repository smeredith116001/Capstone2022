TOPIC IDEAS


Server Deployment- Learning in the ins and outs of different programs used to bring a Server from 
the box to a machine capable of handling whatever requires are being set for the device. 
Why?
I am heading into this topic because I spent the majority of my summer at an Internship with Honeywell where I got a lot of exporsure
to these types of enviorments as well as Vcenter and Vsphere. This project would entail me being an enviorment from scratch
and documenting the entire processs to create a guide on how to deploy a server from scratch using the software I choose

Security+ Exam- I would work towards completeling my Security+ Certificaiton as well as any other 
that I could complete within the time frame. 
Why?
I also spent my summer studying briefly for my Security+
cert. I also got the chance to speak with some really experienced Cybersecurity engineers at Honeywell that told me 
that this cert along with many others are some of the most important tools I can bring into an interview. This 
topic will entail me studying for the Cert as well as speaking to other classmates about the importance of this Cert,
I would also be interesting in creating a formal proposal for a class that helps students get this Certification before 
they get out of school
